# Hey there 👋 I'm Ruan Labuschagne  
*Front-End Developer • Digital Designer • Creative Technologist*

I'm a multidisciplinary front-end developer and digital designer with over a decade of experience building custom websites, user interfaces, and digital experiences that blend creative design with clean, maintainable code.

Whether it's a custom WordPress theme, a complex UI, or a legacy site in need of rescue—I focus on scalable, performance-driven solutions that are as functional as they are visually engaging.
